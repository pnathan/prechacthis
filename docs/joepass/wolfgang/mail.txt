Hi everybody

Thanks to Seans for your posting.
Here are some more informations that you will need to translate the notation on prechacThis to JoePass.pass files.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writing patterns for JoePass! is not that difficult.

A)
undelayed patterns:
In std. siteswap patterns the destination hand is calculated from the number directly.
<  3p 3 1 1p | 1 1p 3p 3>
All throws are odd, so they all go to the opposite hand,both selfs and passes.


7-clubs 2 count
To make it look familiar juggler 2 has to start with the left hand.
Switch the hands of juggler 2
#jugglerStartLeft 2     ! switch hands of juggler 2, do all passes with the right hand
<4p 3|3 4p>                    

JoePass! will take care of the destination hand automatically, so don´t add information about the direction of the passes to the pattern (i.e. don´t add an x to the pass to point out that they go to the other hand.)


B) delayed patterns:
You have 2 options.

B.1)    handle delays automatically
Use the same system as above, i.e. write a siteswap and let the software calculate the direction and the timing.
For example, let´s take the 2 club 2-count on singles. We want all throws on the same height. Siteswap tells us that every throw value must be 3.5.

To change the height of the throws, both jugglers have to delay their right hand.

#jugglerStartLeft 2     ! switch hands of juggler 2, do all passes with the right hand
                                       ! place this command before any delay commands (bug)

#D +                            ! Software handles delays, throw height and direction
#jugglerDelay 1 r 0.5   ! Delay right hand of juggler 1
#jugglerDelay 2 l 0.5   ! Delay left hand of juggler 2 (NB: switched by jugglerStartLeft to right hand)

<4p 3|3 4p>                     ! same pattern as above


This notation reaches it´s limits when you deal with passes < 1, i.e. 0.5p.
This has to be expanded to
#D +                            ! Software handles delays, throw height and direction
#jugglerDelay 1  0.5    ! Delay right hand of juggler 1
<1p|0p>                         ! see discussions about 0x on rec.juggling :)


B.2) handle delays manually
To change the height of the throws, both jugglers have to delay their right hand.

#sx                                     ! no longer plain siteswap. Activate some extensions, here frictional numbers
                                       ! siteswap values must be separated by spaces
                                       ! as long as use spaces between throws, #sx can always be activated


#jugglerStartLeft 2     ! switch hands of juggler 2, do all passes with the right hand
                                       ! place this command before any delay commands (bug)

#D -                                    ! Software _does not_ handles delays, throw height and direction.
                                       ! do it manually
#jugglerDelay 1 r 0.5   ! Delay right hand of juggler 1
#jugglerDelay 2 l 0.5   ! Delay left hand of juggler 2

<3.5px 3.5 | 3.5 3.5px>  ! slightly different pattern

The throw direction is calculated from the integer value (3 in this case).
Therefore, the 3.5 self goes to the other hand, what´s fine here.
The direction of the pass is wrong: without switching the hand it should cross (should go from right to right, i.e. stay in the same hand)
which it will not do according to the rule named above. Add an x to force a throw to the opposite hand.

The <1p|0p> pattern will work with this notation.
#sx                                     ! no longer plain siteswap. Activate some extensions, here frictional numbers
                                       ! siteswap values must be separated by spaces
                                       ! as long as use spaces between throws, #sx can always be activated

#D -                                    ! Software _does not_ handles delays, throw height and direction.
                                       ! do it manually
#jugglerDelay 1 0.5     ! delay both hands of  juggler 1

<0.5p|0.5px>


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here´s an important bit:
you have to write down the whole passing pattern (i.e. not only one juggler) because
a) otherwise it is hard to tell how many jugglers are in the pattern.
b) all commands starting with a # are disabled in JoePass! when the symetric pattern extension is called.


In  the pattern output on prechacThis, you can change
juggler A:              by      <
juggler B: ...          by      |
add an extra            >

and add x to the siteswap values according to the rule eplained above.
This should do the trick.


I hope this makes sense.
